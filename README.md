# Sophia Helps!

## Sophia Explained
Sophia HelpsÂ© is a productivity application with our very own integrated AI companion: Sophia!

Sophia Helps aims to lower students anxiety and stress by simplifying their workflow. This is a huge issue these days.

## Origin of the Idea
We started the project with deciding on the target audience, and chose students as our main end users. We analysed and developed an understanding of the needs, aspirations and problems students face these days.

## Mission
We wanted to simplify students' lives by breaking down their assignments into smaller bite-sized tasks that are less intimidating.

## Main Problems Sophia Helps with
1. Anxiety
2. Workload
3. Poor Time Management
4. Procrastination

## What Makes Sophia Helps different?
When the user creates an account, they are prompted with a questionnaire to understand users preferences and personalise the calendar and work plans.

The questionare results are saved into the users account as their very own archetype.

Now the user can simply copy paste their assignments into the text box. The AI will then read it and create clear and simple tasks the user can complete in order to achieve their goals.

The tasks will automatically be listed out in a todo list and automatically assigned deadlines and put into the integrated calendar.

At the end of each week Sophia will create a summary of what you have achieved during the week to congratualte you and let you know where you are at in terms of your goals.

There is text to audio and speech to text integration for visually impaired students.

## Design
It was important for us to design an app that has calming colours and is accessible to all kinds of users.

## Additions in the works

**Pets**

One of the main driving forces for the user will be their own very pet. When they complete a task, they get to care for the pet and aditionally spend coins they have earned in the shop to buy cute hats, outfits and accessories! When the user fails to meet a deadline, the pet will take damage to their health.

**Avatar Personalisation**

The user will be able to create their avatar and buy accessories for their own avatar!
